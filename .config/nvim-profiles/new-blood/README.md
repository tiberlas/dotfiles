# my nvim version for 2023
# codename: NEW BLOOD

This is my new (2023) nvim configuration
Currently is in develop

GREP IN SPECIFIC FILE:
- open grep and search for the wanted word
- press <C-f>
- then enter the name of the dir in which you want to search/grep

TODO:

- don't show file-tree on start

- for plugin neo-tree:
- - when rename action is run use: `git mv` (this preserves the git file history)
